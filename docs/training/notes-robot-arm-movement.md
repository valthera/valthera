Notes on how to implement the first model and deploy to the vision system

### **Step 1 — Pretrain on DROID (movement prior)**

* Feed DROID video frames into **V-JEPA2** (frozen).
* Train a GRU to predict **end-effector motion** `[Δx, Δy, Δz, Δyaw]` and **gripper actions** (open/close, stop).
* **Goal:** teach the network the *flow* of reach → grasp → move → release.

### **Step 2 — Finetune on your robot (pick & place)**

* Record yourself doing **pick & place** with your robot (camera + joint positions + gripper state).
* Swap the model’s output to **your joint deltas** `[Δq1..Δq4]`, plus grip/stop.
* Finetune the GRU on this data so it learns how to move *your* hardware.

### **Step 3 — Run on the robot**

* Live camera frame → V-JEPA2 → GRU → `[Δq, grip, stop]`.
* Send joint commands to the arm at \~10 Hz.
* Clamp movements and enforce workspace limits for safety.
